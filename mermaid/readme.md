Here's how we can expand the mind map algorithmically, along with some considerations and a revised Mermaid code example:

Expansion Strategy (Factor of Two)

Node Selection:

Breadth-First: Start with the root node, then expand its children, and so on, level by level. This ensures a balanced expansion.
Depth-First: Start with the root, expand one branch as deeply as possible, then backtrack and expand other branches. This might prioritize certain branches over others.
Expansion Criteria:

Fixed Number: Expand each node by adding exactly two new child nodes.
Information-Based: Use existing information about the node to generate relevant subtopics. This requires domain knowledge or access to external data sources.
Content Generation:

Manual: A human expert adds subtopics based on their knowledge.
Automated: Use AI techniques (like GPT-4) to generate plausible subtopics based on the parent node's content.
Considerations

Relevance: Ensure the added subtopics are directly related to the parent node.
Balance: Maintain a balanced structure to avoid overly deep or wide branches.
Termination: Decide when to stop expanding (e.g., maximum depth, number of nodes).

Explanation

We've expanded the "Header Section" node by a factor of two, adding two subtopics to each of its existing children.
The new subtopics are more specific and provide additional detail related to the parent concept.
You can repeat this process for other nodes, choosing a suitable expansion strategy and content generation method.
Algorithmic Implementation (Pseudocode)

function expandMindmap(node, expansionFactor):
    if node is not a leaf node:
        for each child in node.children:
            expandMindmap(child, expansionFactor)
    else: 
        for i in range(expansionFactor):
            newSubtopic = generateSubtopic(node.content) 
            node.addSubtopic(newSubtopic)
